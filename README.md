*Tibia CLI* is a command line interface for showing information from the MMORPG
game called Tibia.

It uses Web Scraping to make looking characters up in the
website easy for a terminal lover!

In the future I am hoping to implement more features such as creature
information, NPCs, spells, and so on.

If you have no idea what Tibia is, feel free to take a look at their website:
